First init

We need to ask the user to role the dice, so we'll have a number generator.
We need to ask if they want to keep rolling.
Have a total score for a player.
End the game after someone reaches 50.


1. Import random.
2. Define a roll function.
This is how we will get a number 1-6.
We will use randomint like before.
3. Ask the player how many players are playing until they give a valid answer.
Have an if statement to check if input is a digit.
Have an if statement to check if their input is between 2 and 4.
Like this:

while True:
    players = input("Enter the number of players (2-4): ")
    if players.isdigit():
        players = int(players)
        if 2 <= players <= 4:
            break
        else:
            print("Must be between 2 - 4 players.")
    else:
        print("Invalid, try again.")

4. Define some variables.
Define a max_score.
Define a size of an array based on the number of players. Like this:

max_score = 50
player_scores = [0 for _ in range(players)]
** This is called a list comprehension.

5. Set up the while loop for the game.
The condition for the while loop to keep going is whenever
it takes the max of the player_scores, it keeps going as long
as it is below 50.

6. We ask the player if they wanna roll. If yes, then we continue.
If not, we break the loop. The loop is pretty simple for now.

7. We grab a roll value by calling the roll function. We must check
if it is equal to 1 to delete their score, or equal to 2-6 to add to
their score. 
We also wanna add a current_score = 0 for now. Everything should
look like this:

while max(player_scores) < max_score:
    current_score = 0

    should_roll = input("Would you like to roll? (y/n)? ").lower()
    if should_roll != 'y':
        break
    
    value = roll()
    if value == 1:
        print("You rolled a 1! Turn done.")
        break
    else:
        current_score += value
        print("You rolled a:", value)
        print("Your score is:", current_score)

8. Since we iterate through each persons turn, we will want a for loop
inside this big while loop, and have the code above inside another while
loop. Like this:

while max(player_scores) < max_score:
    for player_idx in range(players):
        current_score = 0
        while True:
            should_roll = input("Would you like to roll? (y/n)? ").lower()
            if should_roll != 'y':
                break
            
            value = roll()
            if value == 1:
                print("You rolled a 1! Turn done.")
                break
            else:
                current_score += value
                print("You rolled a:", value)
                print("Your score is:", current_score)

9. After a player turn is done, we add their total score to the player_scores
array based on their index. Like this:

        player_scores[player_idx] += current_score
        print("Your total score is:", player_scores[player_idx])

10. Make sure to add that the current_score is 0 when they roll a one.
11. At the beginning of each player's turn we will want to introduce their
turn. Like this: (so at the beginning of the for loop)
        
        print("\nPlayer " + str(player_idx + 1) + "'s turn has just started.\n")

12. We should tell the player at the beginning of their turn what their score is.
Like this: (beginning of the for loop)
        print("Your total score is:", player_scores[player_idx])

13. We want to give everyone have a last roll even if someone reaches 50, if
it wasn't the last person to get a 50. Also, the people who continue to roll
are the people left over in an iteration through the players array if someone
before them gets a 50.

14. Find the max_score, and get the index of that score to see which player won.

Like this:
max_score = max(player_scores)
winning_idx = player_scores.index(max_score)
print("Player number", winning_idx + 1, "is the winner with a score of:", max_score)

15. Game should be done!
